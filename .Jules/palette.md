## 2025-05-15 - [Accessibility Gaps in Bootstrap Templates]
**Learning:** Bootstrap templates like DASHMIN often lack proper ARIA labels for icon-only buttons (sidebar toggler, back-to-top) and correct `lang` attributes when repurposed for other languages.
**Action:** Always check the `html` tag's `lang` attribute against the content language and ensure all icon-only links/buttons have descriptive `aria-label`s.
